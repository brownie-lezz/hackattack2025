## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js and npm
-   Python 3.8+ and pip
-   Git
-   [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) for running the Mistral LLM locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up Ollama (if not already done)
# This will download the Mistral model
ollama pull mistral

# Create a .env file in the backend directory and add your API key
touch .env
```

Your `backend/.env` file should contain:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY"
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the project root and then the frontend directory
# (Assuming you are in the backend directory from the previous step)
cd .. 

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file in the root directory
touch .env
```

Your root `.env` file for the frontend should contain:

```env
